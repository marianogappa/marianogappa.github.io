The incentive for being parasitical is to gain personal wealth, power or otherwise, but this comes at the expense of others&rsquo; rights, well-being and such.</p><p>Unlike biological parasites, humans (generally) possess <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency>moral agency</a>, enabling them to understand the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Piracy</strong>: Enjoying a movie without paying for it.</li><li><strong>Workplace Slacking</strong>: Avoiding effort while still receiving payment.</li><li><strong>Political Budget Abuse</strong>: Profiting at the expense of constituents.</li></ul><p>An important observation is that <strong>as parasites multiply, the system breaks down</strong>:</p><ul><li>If everyone pirates movies, the film industry collapses.</li><li>If every employee slacks off, companies go bankrupt.</li><li>If every politician abuses budgets, governmental dysfunction ensues.</li></ul><p>However, a system with no parasites at all is not ideal; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility>antifragile</a> systems thrive on stressors.</p><h2 id=population-size>Population size</h2><p>The population size of the environment influences the sustainability of parasitical behavior:</p><ul><li>In a large corporation, one can slack off undetected, but this is less feasible in a small startup.</li><li>A skilled corrupt politician can take a very small cut on a large budget for an entire state, but in a small town the same volume of fraud is more likely to be noticed.</li><li>Anonymity in a large city facilitates the abuse of public services; this would be noticeable in a small town.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that founders and engaged managers often <a href=https://world.hey.com/dhh/need-it-take-7-500-people-to-run-twitter-a8cb36a6>prefer small teams</a>, and well-managed states tend to have smaller populations.</p><p><strong>Parasites hide in numbers</strong>. <em>Smart</em> parasites navigate the immune response of systems, allowing them to persist.</p><h2 id=morality>Morality</h2><p>While parasitical behavior seems inherently immoral, the reality is that <strong>we are all parasitical in various ways</strong>:</p><ul><li>Animal cruelty for taste preferences.</li><li>Child labor for cheaper goods.</li><li>Ignoring systemic issues (e.g. inequality, climate collapse) for personal comfort.</li></ul><p><strong>Being indirectly parasitical is not morally superior</strong>; it exploits others equally for the same gain. The question is, <strong>where do we draw the line</strong> on acceptable parasitical behavior?</p><p>Finally, institutionalized parasitical behavior, like exploitative professions and businesses, seem to amplify the immorality.</p><h2 id=being-less-parasitical>Being less parasitical</h2><p>Can societies become less parasitical? Individuals may reject parasitical behavior due to:</p><ul><li>Altruism</li><li>Feeling of being independent</li><li>Reputation concerns</li></ul><p>For those ingrained in parasitical societies, change is challenging.</p><p>It seems that <strong>less parasitical societies are fragile and must be protected</strong>.</p><p>To foster less parasitical behavior:</p><ul><li>Improve well-being: give people bandwidth to care about others.</li><li>Keep communities small for visibility.</li><li>Leverage technology for oversight.</li></ul><h2 id=cognitive-dissonance--rationalisation>Cognitive dissonance & rationalisation</h2><p>If people desire less parasitical surroundings but still engage in parasitical behavior, cognitive dissonance or rationalization may be at play.</p><p>Rationalization branches into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Prideful Parasites</strong>: Those who enjoy exploiting others without seeing it as &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>Necessity Parasites</strong>: Those who believe it&rsquo;s wrong but justify it for achieving personal goals, which needn&rsquo;t be selfish nor extravagant.</li></ul><p>The latter group often views the system as broken, making parasitical behavior necessary. At the same time, they will often be hard-working and just as loving as your closest family member.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, we all exhibit parasitical behaviors to varying degrees. Considering where to draw the line for acceptable parasitical behavior prompts introspection.</p><p>Where do you draw the line?</p></div></article></main></body></html>
