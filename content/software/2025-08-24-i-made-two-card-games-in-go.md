## Introduction

After 15 years as a software engineer, I realized I had never actually built and published a game.

Since I grew up in üá¶üá∑ Argentina playing card games with my friends, I figured I'd choose one of those. I asked myself:

## Truco: 3 Months Without LLMs

On [June 18th of 2024](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/commit/80ad842f546ac5bdf0d680d105afc10b66626d0f) I started building [Truco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truco) in my free time. As a longtime Go backend developer, the backend was obvious. The challenge was the UI and long-term hosting without a paid server.

| Problem   | Solution                                                                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI       | Bit the bullet and learned the minimal required [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI.     |
| No server| Transpiled the server to [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) using [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/).                            |
| Hosting  | Used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the static files.                      |

This was pre-LLM, so every detail had to be figured out by hand. It took about 3 months of trial and error to get it ready.

I never planned to advertise or monetize it; I just wanted to finish, and maybe give someone the joy of playing their childhood game again. A year later, without any extra effort on my part, people are still playing it!

## "Escoba": 3 Days With LLMs

A year later, visiting family in Argentina, I taught my nephew [Escoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escoba)‚Äîthe country‚Äôs second most popular card game (despite what ChatGPT insists).

![two-most-common-card-games](/images/posts/i-made-two-card-games-in-go/two-most-common.png)

With LLMs now mainstream, I wondered how much faster building a game might be‚Äîso I decided to test it.

I cloned the backend for Truco and gave [Claude](https://claude.ai/) a long prompt explaining the rules of Escoba and asking it to refactor the code to implement it. To my surprise, it worked almost perfectly on the first prompt üò±. For a moment I thought: goodbye, job üò∞.

![prompt](/images/posts/i-made-two-card-games-in-go/prompt.png)

The only bug I found was that it used `append` [incorrectly in one place and mutated actions](https://github.com/marianogappa/escoba/commit/e9c373a38cb2ca5e7eefca2870f91e7def1579f7#diff-8e38aecf51e5858a66646d328292fc8abf36f6a602ef3ea4ed7fc1ca2b1a0240L104-L105). Except for that, I only added a few bells and whistles on top (like [a better bot](https://github.com/marianogappa/escoba/commit/fe1c87bed8e9b60cc902dfc563c356506c2faf4c)).

The frontend was a different story; it took me a few days to get it right. The real challenge probably wasn‚Äôt just the LLM ‚Äî it was my own React skills, combined with the unusual setup of letting a black-box WASM function manage game state. Debugging in JavaScript also didn‚Äôt make life easier.

## Step-by-Step: How to Build Your Own Game

I'm assuming you might have come here to see if it's not too hard to give it a try yourself! So I'll give you the minimalistic primer to make your own game with this stack.

I wrote a minimalistic Tic-Tac-Toe game set of repos so you can fork them to get started:

[https://github.com/marianogappa/tictactoe-backend](https://github.com/marianogappa/tictactoe-backend)

### Backend-side

A turn-based backend is straightforward to outline:

- [Initialize](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/truco/truco.go#L157) a [GameState struct](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/truco/truco.go#L16) (e.g. initial board setup, empty actions list).
- Implement [`CalculatePossibleActions`](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/truco/truco.go#L378), so clients know what‚Äôs valid.
- Add [RunAction](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/truco/truco.go#L213) to mutate the GameState.
- If there‚Äôs a bot, write a function to [pick an action](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/examplebot/newbot/bot.go#L38) from the current state.

That's it!

_Note: forget human vs human, unless you're willing to pay for that server._

### Frontend-side

I‚Äôm no frontend expert, but the tasks are simple:

- Call the backend to create a new `GameState`.
- Render it in the UI.
- Let the player pick an action from the valid options.
- Call the backend to apply the action.
- Trigger the bot‚Äôs action when it‚Äôs their turn.

That's it!

### Backend-side interop

To transpile the backend to WASM, you can build with (docs [here](https://go.dev/wiki/WebAssembly)):

```bash
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js go build -o main.wasm main.go
```

But that produces huge binaries (which is slow on mobile). Use [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) for smaller ones.

Before compiling, you need a different entrypoint to the functions that you're going to make available to the frontend. [Make a different `main.go`](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/main_wasm.go) file that exports the functions that you need, and [guard it via build flags](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco/blob/v0.2.0/main_wasm.go#L2):

```go
//go:build tinygo
// +build tinygo

package main

[...]

func main() {
	js.Global().Set("trucoNew", js.FuncOf(trucoNew))
	js.Global().Set("trucoRunAction", js.FuncOf(trucoRunAction))
	js.Global().Set("trucoBotRunAction", js.FuncOf(trucoBotRunAction))
	select {}
}

var (
	state *truco.GameState // "Global variable" for the GameState
	bot   truco.Bot
)
```

Don't forget to block at the end of `main()` with `select {}` to prevent the program from exiting immediately.

### Backend data interop

`GameState` is typically a free-form struct that you define in Go. WASM can‚Äôt directly serialize/deserialize structs. The trick is to pass everything as JSON. After digging through [TinyGo docs](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/), here‚Äôs the formula:

```go
func trucoRunAction(this js.Value, p []js.Value) interface{} { // Always this signature
	// Read the input JSON
    jsonBytes := make([]byte, p[0].Length()) 
	js.CopyBytesToGo(jsonBytes, p[0])

	// 1. Decode the input JSON to your struct
    // 2. Run your Go code, return an output struct
	// 3. Encode the output struct to JSON
	newBytes := _runAction(jsonBytes)

	// Return the output JSON
	buffer := js.Global().Get("Uint8Array").New(len(newBytes))
	js.CopyBytesToJS(buffer, newBytes)
	return buffer
}
```

### Frontend-side interop

Finally, [call the backend functions from the frontend](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco-argentino/blob/main/public/index.html#L45) and [track the GameState in a global variable]((https://github.com/marianogappa/truco-argentino/blob/main/src/gameState.js#L19):

```js
function jsRunAction(data) {
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const encodedData = encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(data));
    const result = trucoRunAction(encodedData);
    const json = new TextDecoder().decode(result);
    return JSON.parse(json);
}

let gameState = jsNewGame();

// Note that RunAction doesn't take a GameState.
// WASM is the source of truth; your frontend can't mutate it.
gameState = jsRunAction(action); 
```

Every time you modify the backend, you need to recompile it to WASM and replace the old file in the frontend. I put this in [the Makefile](https://github.com/marianogappa/escoba-de-15/blob/main/Makefile):

```
compile_library:
	cd $(GOPATH)/src/github.com/marianogappa/escoba && \
	TINYGOROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/tinygo/0.38.0 tinygo build -o main.wasm -target wasm main_wasm.go && \
	mv main.wasm $(CURDIR)/public/wasm/wasm.wasm && \
	cp /usr/local/Cellar/tinygo/0.38.0/targets/wasm_exec.js $(CURDIR)/public/wasm/wasm_exec.js && \
	cd -
```

Note that I'm also copying over `wasm_exec.js`. This is a requirement for running WASM code. The other requirement is to add the [script tag to the HEAD of the HTML file](https://github.com/marianogappa/truco-argentino/blob/main/public/index.html#L16):

```html

    <script src="wasm/wasm_exec.js"></script>
	<script>
        const go = new Go(); // Defined in wasm_exec.js
        const WASM_URL = 'wasm/wasm.wasm';

        var wasm;
        let wasmReady = false;

        if ('instantiateStreaming' in WebAssembly) {
            WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(WASM_URL), go.importObject).then(function (obj) {
                wasm = obj.instance;
                go.run(wasm);
                wasmReady = true;
            })
        } else {
            fetch(WASM_URL).then(resp =>
                resp.arrayBuffer()
            ).then(bytes =>
                WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, go.importObject).then(function (obj) {
                    wasm = obj.instance;
                    go.run(wasm);
                    wasmReady = true;
                })
            )
        }
    </script>
```

## Troubleshooting

### The WASM file is not loading

This works automatically in Github Pages, but locally, you need to serve the files over HTTP. You can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for this:

```bash
npx http-server ./public -p 8080
```

And then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun making these games and I hope you find it interesting to see how it works. I also hope you find it useful to make your own games! If you have questions, I'm not hard to find.
